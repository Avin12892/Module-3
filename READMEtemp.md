# PL-0-Driver
Parser &amp; Compile Driver

The .c files need to be compiled and run from the command line to work correctly

Open a terminal window and go to the directory that has the .c files in it (the xcode project location is easiest)

Compile all of them using (make the name of the produced file the same as it's .c):
gcc nameOfFile.c -o nameOfProducedFile

Then run them using ./nameOfExecutable
CompileDriver will run the full program
